      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Martin Luther King, Jr., was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of a Baptist minister. He completed his formal education with degrees from Morehouse College, Crozier Theological Seminary, and Boston University (Ph.D. in systematic theology, 1955). While serving as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, King led the boycott that resulted in the desegregation of that city‚Äôs bus system. Along with Ralph Abernathy, Ella Baker, and others, he went on to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) ‚Äì commonly described as a group created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of Black churches to conduct nonviolent protest in the service of civil rights. King led SCLC until his death. His resolve in the face of threats to his safety, as well as that of his family, his conviction that ‚Äúinjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,‚Äù and his ability to write and speak with extraordinary power and clarity brought him to national prominence as a leader of the movement to achieve racial justice in America.</p>
      <p>King studied the writings and example of Mohandas K. Gandhi in India who powerfully influenced his philosophy of non-violence. When he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King said, ‚ÄúNon-violence is not sterile passivity, but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation.‚Äù Like Gandhi, King also understood the strategic value of non-violence: ‚ÄúWe have neither the techniques nor the numbers to win a violent campaign.‚Äù His commitment to non-violence led him, over the objections of many people in the civil rights movement, to oppose the war in Vietnam; he understood the connections between racism, militarism, and materialism.</p>
      <p>Like Henry David Thoreau, Dr. King believed in the necessity of resisting unjust laws with civil disobedience. As a leader of many demonstrations in support of the rights of African Americans, he was subject to frequent arrest and imprisonment. His ‚ÄúLetter from a Birmingham Jail‚Äù (1963) was a call to conscience directed primarily at American religious leaders.</p>
      <p>When a fellow civil rights worker was killed after the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, King said: ‚ÄúIf physical death is the price that some must pay to free their children and their white brothers from an eternal psychological death, then nothing can be more redemptive.‚Äù Martin Luther King‚Äôs own redemptive sacrifice was exacted by an assassin‚Äôs bullet on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>This case study is centered around the ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech by Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) in Washington D.C. in August 1963. In stating ‚Äúwe can never be satisfied‚Äù until justice is served, King (1963) alluded to the rampant history of prejudice and racism, and by ‚Äòwe‚Äô he meant the black population of the U.S., fighting for its civil rights. This fight is also known as the civil rights movement in the United States, whose historic and contemporary relevance will be analyzed in this study.</p>

      <h2>Changing the Nation</h2>
      <p>The civil rights movement was a key event in American history. It unraveled from 1955 to 1968, following racial segregation and discrimination. The prior state of the U.S. observed an official policy of segregation in the South, with acts of violence against African Americans protected by law enforcement agencies. Systemic racism in the South was undeniably a reality, but the push for civil rights has changed this dynamic ‚Äì and the nation with it. This ‚Äòpush‚Äô was a nationwide mass campaign to obtain equal social, legal, and economic rights for African Americans in the U.S. Its legislative accomplishments, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, have resulted in a major transformation of the life of the American nation. The movement has fundamentally changed race relations in the U.S. as black activists insisted on full integration and assimilation, dreaming of a nation where race was not a barrier.</p>

    <section class="box" id="effect-on-minorities">
        <h2>Effect on Minority Groups</h2>
        <p>The minority groups across the continent were impacted significantly by the Civil Rights Acts. From the time that first African slaves were brought to the U.S. by colonizers, they were treated as subhuman. In his speech, King (1963) refers to the historic lack of progress since then, painting the picture of a life in poverty, segregation, and discrimination. Upon depicting the horrors of such life, King (1963) calls for granting ‚Äúthe inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness‚Äù to all. Indeed, the civil rights movement led to several legislative victories, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The most widely discussed aspect of this act is its prohibition of segregation and discrimination across the board: for instance, in public facilities, federally funded government agencies, registration rights.</p>

      <section class="box" id="contemporary-relevance">
        <h2>Contemporary Relevance of Ideas</h2>
        <p>The civil rights movement has greatly transformed the nation and perpetrated great social and political changes. It triggered the turbulent cycle of the 1960s and 1970s protests, followed by the 1980s and 1990s, strengthening communication; it has since shaped many social movements. As outlined before, the major sentiment of the civil rights movement was to see all people equal and end segregation. The hope for equality has persisted through the years, inspiring organizations like feminists fighting for women‚Äôs rights. The movement that is often brought up in the context of civil rights ideas is Black Lives Matter.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="box" id="racial-ethnic-conflicts">
        <h2>Contemporary Applicability to Racial and Ethnic Conflicts</h2>
        <p>New social movements like Black Lives Matter analyze historic tactics to address racial conflicts. The civil rights movement arguably succeeded due to its diverse repertoire, and the use of nonviolent protest ways like ‚Äúboycotts, sit-ins, mass street demonstrations, freedom rides and picketing‚Äù fundamentally aided it in accomplishing its goals. King (1963) stressed that protesters ‚Äúmust forever conduct [their] struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline‚Äù and ‚Äúnot allow [their] creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.‚Äù In today‚Äôs context of the rise of racism in mass incarceration, police killings of unarmed black civilians, and white resentment towards the African American population, social order is threatened. Jones-Eversley et al. (2017) argue that such nonviolent tactics are still effective for encouraging the target public (white Americans) to increase their support for the protesting group (African Americans).</p>

      <section class="box" id="impact-on-diversity">
        <h2>Impact on Diversity</h2>
        <p>The Civil Rights Movement has left a substantial mark on American society. While it has opened the U.S. to acknowledging and embracing cultural diversity, the current state of diversity is still arguably flawed. The civil rights movement opposed ethnically discriminatory immigration policies and called for multiculturalism, which eventually altered the racial composition of immigrants in the U.S. population. Such an impact on diversity is truly significant; however, there may be more issues beyond the surface acknowledgment. Smooha (2018) states that liberal multiculturalism in Western democracies consists mainly of the authorization of various forms of cultural expression that are consistent with liberal democratic ideals. But it does not fully incorporate racial justice.</p>
